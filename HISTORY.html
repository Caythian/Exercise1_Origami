            Origami, the ancient art of paper folding, has a long and rich history. While it's most commonly associated with Japanese culture, paper folding as an art form has been practiced in various cultures worldwide.

            Origin of Origami
        </p>
        <p class="body">
            China: Paper was invented in China around the 1st century AD. The earliest recorded instances of paper folding also come from this time period, but these were rudimentary forms, likely ceremonial in nature.
        <p class="body">
            Japan: By the 6th century, paper made its way to Japan via Buddhism. Here, the art of paper folding was refined and evolved into what we recognize today as origami. In Japan, it was initially used for religious purposes; paper butterflies symbolized weddings, and paper models were often used as offerings.

        <p class="body">
            In the beginning, due to the cost of paper, origami was a pastime of the elite. However, as paper became more affordable, it became popular among the masses.
        </p>
        <p class="body">
            The first known origami book, Tsutsumi-no-Ki, was written in 1680 and it described a few basic models.
        </p>
        <p class="body">
            In the 18th century, a more comprehensive compilation, "Senbazuru Orikata" (Thousand Crane Folding), was published, showcasing the famous crane model.

        </p>
        <p class="body">
            Akira Yoshizawa: Often called the grandmaster of origami, Yoshizawa is credited with elevating the art to its modern form in the 20th century. He developed a system of symbols, arrows, and diagrams to teach paper folding, which is widely used today.
        </p>
        <p class="body">
            Mathematics: In the latter half of the 20th century, the connection between origami and mathematics became more pronounced. Dr. Robert Lang, a leading origami artist and former NASA physicist, is notable for his use of mathematical principles in paper folding. He has crafted incredibly intricate designs using algorithms and computations.
